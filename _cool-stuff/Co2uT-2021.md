On Saturday May 22nd, 2021, some friends and I crawled out of a quarantine stupor and decided to race gravel bikes very far. <br>

The [Co2Ut](https://www.desertgravel.com/co2ut/) Utahraptor was 125 miles of gravel riding through the desert along the Colorado and Utah border. It was long. It was hot. It was bumpy. It was fun. <br>
