On Saturday May 22nd, 2021, some friends and I crawled out of a quarantine stupor and decided to race bikes very long distances. The [Co2Ut](https://www.desertgravel.com/co2ut/) Utahraptor was 125 miles of gravel riding through the desert along the Colorado and Utah border. It was long. It was hot. It was bumpy. It was fun. You can check out the activity here: <br>

I rode my trusty 2016 Niner BSB RDO and, despite a minor mechanical issue the day before the race, had no issues along the route. <br>
