In healthy adults and animals, movement speeds are often chosen to reduce the energy expended; thus, is MS-related slowness of walking and arm reaching linked to increased effort costs? Here, we hypothesized that the costs of walking would be higher in MS due to gait-related impairments such as spasticity, balance deficits, or worsened fitness; whereas the costs of seated reaching would be no different due to its divorce from the sensorimotor covariates associated with elevated walking costs and low cardiorespiratory demand.
