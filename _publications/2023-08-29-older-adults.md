Healthy aging coincides with a reduction in speed, or vigor, of walking, reaching, and eye movements. Here we focused on disentangling two opposing sources of aging-related movement slowing: reduced reward sensitivity due to loss of dopaminergic tone, or increased energy expenditure movements related to mitochondrial or muscular inefficiencies. Through a series of three experiments and construction of a computational model, here we demonstrate that transient changes in reaction time and movement speed together offer a quantifiable metric to differentiate between reward- and effort-based alterations in movement vigor. Further, we suggest that objective increases in the metabolic cost of moving, not reductions in reward valuation, are driving much of the movement slowing occurring alongside healthy aging.
