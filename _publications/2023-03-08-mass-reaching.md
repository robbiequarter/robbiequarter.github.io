On any given day, we make countless reaching movements to objects around us. While such ubiquity may suggest uniformity, each movement’s speed is unique - why is this? Reach speed is known to be influenced by accuracy; we slow down to sustain high accuracy. However, in other forms of movement like walking or running, metabolic cost is o`en the primary determinant of movement speed. Here we bridge this gap and ask: how do metabolic cost and accuracy interact to determine speed of reaching movements?
