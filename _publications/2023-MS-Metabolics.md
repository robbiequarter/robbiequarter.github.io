Individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) often move more slowly than those without the disease. A possible cause is that movements in MS are more energetically expensive and slowing is an adaptation to conserve metabolic resources. Here, we find that while walking is more costly for persons with MS, arm reaching movements are not. These results bring into question the driving force of movement slowness in MS and implicate other motor related networks contributing to slowing.
