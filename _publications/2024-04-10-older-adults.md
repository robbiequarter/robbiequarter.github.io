Why do we move slower as we grow older? The reward circuits of the brain, which tend to invigorate movements, decline with aging, raising the possibility that reduced vigor is due to the diminishing value that our brain assigns to movements. However, as we grow older, it also becomes more effortful to make movements. Is age-related slowing principally a consequence of increased effort costs from the muscles, or reduced valuation of reward by the brain? Here, we first quantified the cost of reaching via metabolic energy expenditure in human participants (male and female), and found that older adults consumed more energy than the young at a given speed. Thus, movements are objectively more costly for older adults. Next, we observed that when reward increased, older adults, like the young, responded by initiating their movements earlier. Yet, unlike the young, they were unwilling to increase their movement speed. Was their reluctance to reach quicker for rewards due to the increased effort costs, or because they ascribed less value to the movement? Motivated by a mathematical model, we next made the young experience a component of aging by making their movements more effortful. Now the young responded to reward by reacting faster but chose not to increase their movement speed. This suggests that slower movements in older adults are partly driven by an adaptive response to an elevated effort landscape. Moving slower may be a rational economic response the brain is making to mitigate the elevated effort costs that accompany aging.
